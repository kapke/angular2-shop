          <li>Create second repository service using <code>Http</code> module to provide products data from server. To obtain data you can use following URL: <code>https://shining-torch-4509.firebaseio.com/products.json</code>. You can also create <code>.json</code> files containing data about products - webpack will serve them correctly.
          </li>
          <li>Create an interface for products repository. All implementations should implement it properly. Check whether it's possible to switch between them by making exactly one change in providers declaration
          </li>
          <li><span class="label label-warning">Additional</span>Add retrying 5 times to Http&ndash;based implementation. Check if it works properly by changing data URI into invalid one.
          </li>
          <li><span class="label label-warning">Additional</span>Change retrying strategy to add 1 second delay between tries.
          </li>
          <li><span class="label label-warning">Additional</span>Refactor code: make sure that every action is performed in proper place.
